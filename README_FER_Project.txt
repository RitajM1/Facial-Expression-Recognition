Facial Expression Recognition Using VGG16, PCA, and SVM/Random Forest

This project is part of the ARTI406 – Machine Learning course at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University.

🔬 Project Summary

We developed a hybrid deep learning and machine learning pipeline to classify human emotions from facial images using the FER-2013 dataset. The system uses a pre-trained VGG16 CNN for deep feature extraction, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, and classifies emotions using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers.

- Best Accuracy: 53.9% (VGG16 + PCA + SVM)
- Dataset: FER-2013 Facial Expression Recognition Dataset
- Models Used: VGG16, PCA, SVM, Random Forest
- Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn

⚙️ Pipeline

1. Data loading & preprocessing (resize to 224×224, RGB conversion, normalization)
2. Feature extraction using pre-trained VGG16 (top layers removed)
3. Dimensionality reduction with PCA (500 components)
4. Classification using:
   - SVM (Linear Kernel) with hyperparameter tuning
   - Random Forest (100 estimators)
5. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

📁 Dataset

We used the publicly available FER-2013 dataset:
